    <p>Gay India and Indian Gay and Lesbian Resources by Utopia Asia: India's newly emerging LGBT communities, along with its variegated sexual behaviors that defy easy categorization, provide substantiation of the diversity of human sexuality; a diversity that is more visible than ever as the social freedoms sweeping through Asia erode irrelevant strictures of colonial laws and religious superstition. Having only recently struck down it's anti-buggary laws and with very few positive openly LGBT role models, society is still largely uneducated about homosexuality and, partly because of having been criminalized for so many years, it is still shameful to be identified as gay. Gays are reluctant to be stereotyped in the public mind as being effeminate or transgender, and non-conformity is one of the biggest fears for self-identified LGBT. Most challenging to change will be the unique relationship between Indian sons and mothers. Women largely secure their social status by raising their sons to be gods - gods who worship their mothers. While daughters are farmed off to serve their husband's family, Mum is largely focused on getting her boy married. Once married, he has only to produce a male heir and then he is free to resume his natural inclinations. The pressure to please Mum is accute and most homosexuals in India will eventually succumb, whether they have any interest in the opposite sex or not. Thus, this karmic tragedy continues to repeat until the day mothers prioritize their gay sons' happiness or sons get the courage to just say "no." Yet there is hope. Rallying to their children's side during the 2012 Supreme Court review of the Delhi High Court's overturn of the buggery law, Indian television viewers got to hear some radical words from a large group of parent's who chastised opponents - "how dare you say the ruling is anti-family! We are the families."</p>
